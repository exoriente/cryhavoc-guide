### Martial traditions

Spider elves have an alliance with giant spiders. They permit them to live in their woods and consider them an intelligent race. When war calls they ride spiders into combat, but the elves do not consider the spiders to be their mounts and more of a brother in arms.

    - These places are strange mazes of web magic and the collaboration of elf and spider allows for the creation of mythical fabric and garments of spider silk

#### Forest

Spider elves have close connection to the woods the live in. Soul of their forest is almost worshipped as deity. When in desperate need, the can call upon the very forest to go to war. Giant trees have been known to wade into battle, eliminating enemy forces by the thousends.
